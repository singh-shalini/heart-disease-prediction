# heart-disease-prediction
A machine learning project that involves working with heart-disease related data from Kaggle, preprocessing it, then developed a predictive ML model.

The project aims to: 
1. Develop a predictive ML model to determine the likelihood of heart disease based on 
multiple health indicators. 
2. Evaluate model performance using various metrics to ensure reliability. 
3. Visualize relationships between features and outcomes to interpret the modelâ€™s results. 
4. Build an interactive interface using Gradio to make predictions accessible to non
technical users.
